Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Were gonna give it another try.
This is so great.
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.

You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Well, I think it's perfect.

Alright, well, be good, I love you.
I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
That's right baby.
Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Its a great class.

Hey!  Hey!
Hi!
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Wow!

Well, youre amazing.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh-no-no-no, you are!
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Hmmm... this is so nice.
It's brilliant!
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any
Well, you promised me a fun road trip!

It's me, Joey!
Left!  Thank you.
Yeah absolutely!
Oh thats all right!
Yknow, I ended up having a really good time.
Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
Thats right!
I like it!
Oh good.
You are so adorable.
That! Lets talk about that.
Hey!
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Hey!
Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping
Oh, they're firemen guys.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Thanks a lot.
So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
Did that!
You know the song! Sing along!
Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yes! Santa's coming!
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Hi! Phoebe.
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.
They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!
Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure Im not doing anything Tuesday.
Oh, great!
Youre a genius, Ross.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Hey!
...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Ok, that'll be great!
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Oh, great!
We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Oh, would you look at that Monica?
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Thats right!
Cause Im a Tribbiani!
We can eat!

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
I'd like to propose a toast.
Little toast here, ding ding.
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet.

Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
Oh hey! You got my parents gift!

That really is something; that's really cool.
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should get another pair!
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.

All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
