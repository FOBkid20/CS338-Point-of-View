Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How bad is this?
Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere!
The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!
Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I wont leave you!
You know, I, you know, can't do this.
What? Is it my breath?
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Oh, I cant watch this.
No-o-o!!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
My lighters in there!
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me.
Uh-oh.
Really? You think so?
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
I dont want a ghost.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
Im, Im freaking out!
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
Wait!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.
Uh-oh!
Noo!  Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.
Where are you Leslie?
Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
Are we okay now?
But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?
Brenda a bee!
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
The charity's on fire!
Help!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
No dont I beg of you!
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Uh-oh.
I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
What should I wear, now Im all nervous.
I think youve got concussion.
Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.
Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
She is gonna hate me.
I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
Joey, I am scared to death about this.
But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
I was scared of telling you.
DANGER
You'd better act surprised.
No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
No-no. We
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Come on, pick up, pick up!
Oh, uh..
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think youre kidding.
What?
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
F-hah.... flennin....
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
Its-its too soon.
You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
They-they-they can smell fear.
What did, what did he say?
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Don't say it.
Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
I cant watch!
Terrified.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
What am I gonna do?!
Dude, what am I gonna
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
Oh no, youll have to come.
No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
What am I going to do?
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Oh God...
Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay?
Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it on the lose? Is it watching me?
Uh-oh.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im
Are you really gonna do this?
It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool.
Okay, here goes.
Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love Rachel.
Oh Joey don't!
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
I did not mean to touch thatI mean
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa!!
I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Just uh, just stand up straight.
Take a couple deep breaths.
Look confident.
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong.
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Sure, now Im scared.
Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
How do you know?
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
But if...
Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
Uh-oh.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Ooh, now you lost me.
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!
Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!
Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.
Um, no.
Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!
Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
No, dont look directly at them!
Just hear me out!
This is a freaky place.
Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
I dont know what Im going to do!
Well, I-I said yes.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Let her know I like her?
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Does it?
Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Oh God.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology!
But the auditions in a couple hours and I dont even understand the game.
No-no-no-no!
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys?
Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?
I-I, I have to tell you something.
Umm, Ive been thinking, Im just gonna come out and say it.
Okay?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say.
Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.
But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.
So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?
Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there!
No no no!
Oh no.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Yes!
Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
I am brave!
II am brave!
No-no-no-no!!
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.
Oh no-no, I cant do that.
Okay, all right dont judge me to much.
God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do that?
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
Uh-oh.
What am I going to do?
I don't know you guys.
No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Shh! Get me out of here.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
But they're not here yet!
Oh, god.
No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
I dont want to lose you!
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Bob?
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
Oh no
This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
