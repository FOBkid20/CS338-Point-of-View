C: Youre a genius!
R: Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!

C: Hey, whats up?
R: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.

C: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
R: Were so sorry.

C: Yeah, were gonna go.
R: Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she

C: And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club!
R: Divorced mens club.

C: Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
R: Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.

C: When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?
R: Where does that leave me?

C: Who am I?
R: There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.

C: You wanna explain that?
R: I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.

C: It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
R: I'm sorry, you were fighting.

C: Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
R: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.

C: Oh no! Why?
R: Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.

C: Well, now I do!!
R: Im sorry.

C: Im sorry.
R: Seven years.

C: Seven years.
R: I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....

C: I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....
R: Aw, God Ross. Oh.

C: No you wont.
R: Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry.

C: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
R: Look, I'm sorry, all right.

C: Look, I'm sorry, all right.
R: I never meant for you to find out!

C: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
R: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to

C: In
R: Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.

C: I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
R: We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.

C: And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
R: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.

C: Uh, this is too weird.
R: I feel stupid.

C: Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call me okay?
R: Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great

C: ..Excuse me?
R: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!

C: Joey, onstage!
R: Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?

C: Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
R: I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.

C: Where are you Vic?
R: Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.

C: In a minute!!
R: So this is it? Victor?

C: So this is it? Victor?
R: Yeah, I guess it is.

C: Yeah, I guess it is.
R: Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me.

C: Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me.
R: One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.

C: One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.
R: But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I.

C: But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I.
R: And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.

C: And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
R: But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone.

C: So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her.
R: So long, Vic!

C: That proposal, at the planetarium
R: I know, I know it was stupid.

C: Oh, hi! How are you doing?
R: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.

C: Okay.
R: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said.

C: Ityknow what?
R: It just doesn't matter how I feel.

C: It just doesn't matter how I feel.
R: I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?

C: Um, I'm not.
R: Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.

C: Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.
R: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.

C: Hi.  Umm, I think theres something that we really need to talk about.
R: I think we do. Why dont we go inside?  Look uh, I know why youre here.

C: Which would be fine, except you totally are.
R: Itsits complicated okay?

C: Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
R: Look, weve been together.

C: Okay?
R: And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.

C: And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
R: Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma.

C: Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma.
R: I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me.

C: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.
R: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

C: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
R: Sorry.

C: How's the hair?
R: I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.

C: Can we see her?
R: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.

C: Yeah, sweetie.
R: I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?

C: I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?
R: No.

C: No.
R: What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!

C: What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!
R: Im gonna miss you!

C: Im gonna miss you!
R: I mean its the end of an era!

C: I mean its the end of an era!
R: I know!

C: Oh well, its not so bad.
R: Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.

C: Oh, how bad is it?
R: Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do

C: Hows your room Rach?
R: Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.

C: Ross, we can handle this.
R: Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.

C: Yeah, it did.
R: So, I guess this is over.

C: What?
R: Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.

C: Why, exactly?
R: Because of the weekend, we had a fight.

C: Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
R: Oh God, Im so sorry.

C: Could you press up too please?
R: Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.

C: How about you?
R: Car accident.

C: Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been, Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
R: Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.

C: The three losers.
R: Oh, poor Lily.

C: Oh, poor Lily.
R: Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.

C: Yknow?
R: No more Joey and Chans.

C: No more Joey and Chans.
R: No more J and Cs.

C: Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
R: Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.

C: Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
R: Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.

C: Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
R: Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!

C: Right!
R: Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.

C: Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.
R: I mean, I remember a time when

C: Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?
R: And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.

C: Thanx.
R: Will the stable boy never get the princess??

C: Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?
R: I didn't think I could ever love again.

C: Nothing!
R: Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.

C: Good day for married people huh?
R: Im sorry your husband cheated on you.

C: I cant believe Im going to lose this job!
R: Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?

C: Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.
R: Okay, Im sorry.

C: Okay, Im sorry.
R: I didnt mean to scare you.

C: You remember not having sex in high school, right?
R: Yeah.

C: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
R: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.

C: And I don't even know how it happened.
R: I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.

C: Who? Me the attacker?
R: Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.

C: Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
R: Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.

C: Of course!
R: Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh

C: Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
R: Ohh, Im sorry.

C: This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
R: Well, I-I guess I gotta go.

C: Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
R: Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?

C: Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

C: Sorry.
R: Im sorry Joey.

C: Whoa! What?! Why?!
R: Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.

C: What happened?
R: Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.

C: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
R: I'm sorry, man.

C: I mean, what about those
R: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?

C: I can't write!
R: Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?

C: Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
R: I can't do it.

C: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
R: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.

C: Im sorry.
R: Ohhh. Dont go.

C: So why cant the three of us go out together?
R: Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.

C: Did he call?
R: No. Sorry.

C: Come on!
R: Its like the end of an era!

C: Its like the end of an era!
R: No more J-man and Channies!

C: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
R: Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.

C: I didnt make it!
R: Im sorry!

C: I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
R: Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby

C: But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
R: So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

C: Ooh, it's not a toy.
R: Well, I don't know what else to do.

C: Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
R: Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.

C: Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
R: I dont think hes the one Im sad about.

C: I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
R: Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.

C: Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
R: Yeah, maybe.

C: Yeah, maybe.
R: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.

C: Any luck?
R: Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?

C: Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
R: I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.

C: What is it? Hey!
R: Really its nothing. Im just

C: Rach come on, what?
R: Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

C: What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
R: Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.

C: Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
R: Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?

C: Yeah, I guess so.
R: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?

C: Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
R: Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.

C: Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
R: Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.

C: It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
R: Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here

C: Hey.
R: Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.

C: No. But thanks.
R: Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?

C: If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
R: Yeah, I know.

C: Yeah, I know.
R: I mean, no, youre right.

C: Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
R: But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.

C: See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
R: Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.

C: Hey! He beat ya.
R: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.

C: So what does this mean?
R: I'm gonna have to give him up.

C: Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
R: I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.

C: Do I ever.
R: Chris says theyre closing down the bar.

C: Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
R: Got me.

C: You really think that is what he meant?
R: Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.

C: Ill see you later.
R: Dont go!

C: Dont go!
R: Im sorry.

C: Im sorry.
R: Im so sorry!

C: Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
R: Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.

C: Oh my God, wh-what happened?
R: Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!

C: I knew that was him!
R: Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.

C: Hey, you ok?
R: I guess.

C: Yeah?
R: Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.

C: She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
R: Mike and I broke up.

C: Mike and I broke up.
R: It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.

C: Oh my God!
R: I'm sorry.

C: I'm sorry.
R: I'm sorry too.

C: Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
R: I couldnt do it.

C: Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
R: Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.

C: Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
R: I want him to have his uncle.

C: I want him to have his uncle.
R: Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

C: Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?
R: Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!

C: So?
R: SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.

C: You can spill. In the sink.
R: Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.

C: Aww, good.  What?
R: What? Im just said.

C: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
R: I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.

C: Yeah.
R: Does it still hurt?

C: Does it still hurt?
R: Yeah.

C: If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
R: I dont want to lose you.

C: I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
R: Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.

C: I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
R: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a

C: But y'know what?
R: Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.

C: Why?
R: Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.

C: Okay.
R: Im sorry.

C: So, rocks.
R: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.

C: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
R: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice

C: Yknow what? I am
R: Im sorry. Im so sorry.

C: I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!
R: By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.

C: Problem odour in the litter box? Dont change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
R: Sorry, Pheebs.

C: Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isnt tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
R: Yeah. Well, umm.....

C: Rach, are you okay?
R: Yeah, Im fine.

C: You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
R: No! Really, no, please, please, thats, thats okay.

C: All right, all right, Im coming over, and Im bringing Chinese food.
R: Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry.

C: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
R: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.

C: Well so?
R: I cant.

C: I cant.
R: I cant.

C: I cant.
R: She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.

C: She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
R: Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.

C: You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
R: Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.

C: Its
R: Ohh, okay, Im sorry.

C: That's right.
R: Barry, I'm sorry...

C: Barry, I'm sorry...
R: I am so sorry...

C: I am so sorry...
R: I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...

C: Yeah, huh.
R: Ive got some bad news.

C: Okay.
R: Well were gonna miss you around here.

C: Well were gonna miss you around here.
R: Yeah, me too.

C: I did.
R: Oh.

C: Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
R: Im such a jerk.

C: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
R: I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

C: Oh my god.
R: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

C: Hey, what's up?
R: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.

C: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
R: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

C: What's happenin'?
R: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.

C: Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
R: So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.

C: Okay, see? I told you!
R: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.

C: David who?
R: David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!

C: And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
R: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.

C: Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal.
R: Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.

C: Which one?
R: Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.

C: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
R: Y'know, for me anyway.

C: Y'know, for me anyway.
R: And of course, the Indians.

C: Hi Phoebe.
R: I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow.

C: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
R: I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.

C: Okay, bye!!
R: So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?

C: No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
R: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.

C: Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!
R: Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.

C: What?
R: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.

C: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
R: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...

C: Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
R: Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?

C: Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
R: I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.

C: Really?
R: Sorry.

C: What?!
R: Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.

C: Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
R: Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.

C: Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
R: She knows, and she wont tell me.

C: She knows, and she wont tell me.
R: Aww Pheebs, that sucks!

C: Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
R: Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.

C: Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
R: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.

C: Is that all?
R: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?

C: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
R: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.

C: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
R: Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!

C: I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
R: Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.

C: Hey everybody!
R: Uh, Im gonna kill myself!

C: No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
R: Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.

C: Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know.
R: Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.

C: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
R: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a

C: Hey, its me.
R: I know you cant stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone.

C: Wow.
R: Theres one thing missing.

C: Yeah!
R: When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!

C: Chandler!

C: Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
R: Well yeah, I lied before.

C: Bye.
R: I-I cant believe Jills gone.  I cant help it, I opened a gate.

C: Look, forget about it, okay?
R: Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.

C: What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
R: Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.

C: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
R: Ross, it's too hard.

C: Yes.
R: Well uh if you must know Im a widower.

C: Well uh if you must know Im a widower.

C: Hi.
R: Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.

C: So  Im gonna go now.
R: Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!

R: Look, is there something wrong with me?

C: Look, is there something wrong with me?
R: I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?

C: I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
R: Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!

C: Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!

R: And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.

C: And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
R: Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.

C: Oh God youre right.
R: Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?

C: We can, we can go to Aruba!
R: When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.

C: When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
R: You would've liked it.

C: Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
R: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.

C: For what?
R: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.

C: Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
R: Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.

C: Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
R: We ruined everything.

C: We ruined everything.
R: Ugh

C: Hey!
R: I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.

C: I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
R: Ohh, thats too bad!

C: Eh
R: Okay well thats good to know.

C: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
R: All right, all right, you're right

C: Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
R: Your good heart Rach,  and, and....

C: No.
R: I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.

C: I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
R: I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.

C: God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
R: Its just changed, everything.

C: Its just changed, everything.
R: Forever.

C: Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
R: Then how come it is?

C: Look what happened!
R: Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.

C: And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.
R: Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.

C: Phoebe, what's the matter?
R: Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

C: Hey. What, what are you doing here?
R: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.

C: No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
R: And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.

C: And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
R: Oh.

C: Heh?
R: Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...

C: Whats-whats this nonsense?
R: All right, Im-Im not English.

C: I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
R: Im sorry.

C: Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
R: Yeah but

C: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
R: I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?

C: What do you mean?
R: Carol our sex life isits just not working

C: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
R: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.

C: Why would we do that?
R: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.

C: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
R: Nooo!

C: Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.
R: Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?

C: But its $2,000.
R: Sorry.

C: Hey.
R: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.

C: Bye!
R: Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.

C: I cant believe this!
R: I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.

C: I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
R: Youre, youre really, youre so good.

C: Youre, youre really, youre so good.
R: Thanks.

C: The whole universe!
R: I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.

C: Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
R: Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost.

C: Please!
R: Look, I just lost my other job.

C: Okay?
R: You have no idea how much I need this.

C: You have no idea how much I need this.
R: Please, help me out, for old times sake.

C: Please, help me out, for old times sake.
R: This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless.

C: I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it.
R: I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.

C: Yeah, but not just that.
R: Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less

C: None the less.
R: None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.

C: Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
R: My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.

C: Joey, that papers like a year old!
R: Aw! Does that mean the

C: Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
R: Oh, what is wrong with me lately?

C: Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
R: Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.

C: Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
R: Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.

C: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
R: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

C: Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
R: 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.

C: And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
R: It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.

C: It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.
R: That was a pretty tough year.

C: Lets go.
R: It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.

C: You bet.  Maybe some other time?
R: Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!

C: So what are you gonna do?
R: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.

C: Oh God, oh.
R: Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...

C: So umm, does it?
R: Im sorry.

C: Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
R: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.

C: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
R: And I do, I have to make

C: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That
R: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.

C: Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
R: Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.

C: And I thought I would bring them to you, yknow, in bed.
R: Oh, you have been through so much.

C: Oh, you have been through so much.
R: I have.

C: Sorry, that was wax.
R: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.

C: Yknow what?
R: Youre right, Im sorry.

C: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the worlds worst hangover! Ross, listen, if
R: All right. All right, Ill do it.

C: It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
R: Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!

C: Ill be here.
R: Not smoking.

C: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
R: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.

C: I know.
R: Its hard this whole platonic thing.

C: Hi.
R: Hi, listen, Im sorry about before.

C: I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I
R: Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.

C: You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
R: I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.

C: Why are you here?
R: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...

R: You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....

C: What?
R: One more chance Ursula, please?

C: You still can't stand her can you?
R: I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.

C: You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
R: Ooh, I miss dating.

C: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
R: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.

C: How can I?
R: Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?

C: Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
R: How can I accept that...

C: How can I accept that...
R: I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.

C: Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
R: Please, promise me that youll tell her that.

C: I just can't believe you're in here.
R: I mean, what am I gonna do without you?

C: Oh no.
R: Oh, I am so sorry.

C: Well, why dont think of someone else for a change?
R: Okay, Im sorry.

C: I am sorry, but some of us have to
R: Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.

C: Well, Im not gonna talk because

R: I-I am so sorry, Ill go.

C: I-I am so sorry, Ill go.
R: Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.

C: I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
R: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.

C: Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
R: Oh.

C: Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
R: I-I wasnt in that.

C: Varrrrrrrrroom.
R: All right, Ill leave.

C: All right, Ill leave.
R: My beds so boring.

R: Okay, I dont know what to do anymore.

C: All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
R: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.

C: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
R: Did I use that already today? Im sorry.

C: My God! What did you order?!
R: Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!

C: Honey, its gonna be okay.
R: No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!

C: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
R: Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.

C: Oh I, I have plans tonight.
R: Oh.

C: Listen, um...
R: I'm sorry.

C: Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.

R: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were

C: Hey man, how did the audition go?
R: Estelle said I didn't get it.

C: So, uh, how's she doing?
R: The doctor says it's a matter of hours.

C: Well then well get wet.
R: Ohh. And I dont even have a date.

C: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
R: Were never gonna find anybody.

R: Oh, Im so sorry.

C: They were in his office.
R: Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.

R: Manhattan does not have enough stores.

C: Okay.
R: Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship

C: I dont know exactly.
R: Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.

C: But you said he was this great guy!
R: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.

C: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
R: You do attract some stinkers.

C: No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
R: I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."

C: Yknow, its too late!
R: You missed youre chance!

C: You missed youre chance!
R: Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.

C: Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
R: Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.

C: Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.

C: Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
R: I know honey, Im sorry.

C: I know honey, Im sorry.
R: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.

C: Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
R: Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....

R: No. No, you're not a loser.

C: Thanks.
R: Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.

R: Anyway, she didnt want to stay.

C: All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
R: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.

R: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.

C: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
R: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.

C: How could it not be?
R: I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.

C: I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
