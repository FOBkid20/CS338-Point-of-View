Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Were so sorry.
Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she
Divorced mens club.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Where does that leave me?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.
I'm sorry, you were fighting.
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.
Im sorry.
Seven years.
I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry.
Look, I'm sorry, all right.
I never meant for you to find out!
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.
I feel stupid.
Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Im sorry.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me.
One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.
But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I.
And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone.
So long, Vic!
I know, I know it was stupid.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said.
It just doesn't matter how I feel.
I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
I think we do. Why dont we go inside?  Look uh, I know why youre here.
Itsits complicated okay?
Look, weve been together.
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma.
I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?
No.
What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!
Im gonna miss you!
I mean its the end of an era!
I know!
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
So, I guess this is over.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Oh God, Im so sorry.
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Car accident.
Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Oh, poor Lily.
Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!
God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here.
No more Joey and Chans.
No more J and Cs.
Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.
I mean, I remember a time when
And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
I didn't think I could ever love again.
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Okay, Im sorry.
I didnt mean to scare you.
Yeah.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
Ohh, Im sorry.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Sorry.
Im sorry Joey.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
I'm sorry, man.
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
I can't do it.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
Im sorry.
Ohhh. Dont go.
Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
No. Sorry.
Its like the end of an era!
No more J-man and Channies!
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.
Im sorry!
Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Well, I don't know what else to do.
Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Really its nothing. Im just
Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Yeah, I know.
I mean, no, youre right.
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
Got me.
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Dont go!
Im sorry.
Im so sorry!
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
I guess.
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
Mike and I broke up.
It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
I couldnt do it.
Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
What? Im just said.
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
I dont want to lose you.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Im sorry.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
Im sorry. Im so sorry.
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Yeah, Im fine.
No! Really, no, please, please, thats, thats okay.
Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
I cant.
I cant.
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
Barry, I'm sorry...
I am so sorry...
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
Ive got some bad news.
Well were gonna miss you around here.
Yeah, me too.
Oh.
Im such a jerk.
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from
Well, the old lady died.
Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.
So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Y'know, for me anyway.
And of course, the Indians.
I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow.
I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.
Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Sorry.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
She knows, and she wont tell me.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.
Uh, Im gonna kill myself!
Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a
I know you cant stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone.
Theres one thing missing.
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!
I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Well yeah, I lied before.
I-I cant believe Jills gone.  I cant help it, I opened a gate.
'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
No.
No. Sorry man.
No. Im just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been    revoked again!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Aww, is it broken?
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.
It's my friends.
They-they have a liking problem with you.
In that, um, they don't.
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
I cant do this.
Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
Im sorry, its not very fair to you.
Oh God. Im sorry about this.
No...
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill
Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Ross, it's too hard.
Well uh if you must know Im a widower.
Oh thats terrible. Im-Im really sorry.
Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!
So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a
Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.
Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.
This is hard.
Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Yeah, but I didnt get to see it.
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Im sorry daddy.
Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
Look, is there something wrong with me?
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!
I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?
Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
I-Im really sorry.
And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
I cant seem to say goodbye.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
Ohh, thats too bad!
Okay well thats good to know.
All right, all right, you're right
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
Its just changed, everything.
Forever.
Then how come it is?
Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.
Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.
Im sorry.
And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
Oh.
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
All right, Im-Im not English.
Im sorry.
Yeah but
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Carol our sex life isits just not working
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Nooo!
Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
Sorry.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.
I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
Youre, youre really, youre so good.
Thanks.
I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost.
Look, I just lost my other job.
You have no idea how much I need this.
Please, help me out, for old times sake.
This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless.
I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Aw! Does that mean the
Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.
That was a pretty tough year.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Im sorry.
is for me not to see you anymore.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
And I do, I have to make
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
Oh, you have been through so much.
I have.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.
Youre right, Im sorry.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
All right. All right, Ill do it.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
Not smoking.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Its hard this whole platonic thing.
Hi, listen, Im sorry about before.
Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
One more chance Ursula, please?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Ooh, I miss dating.
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
How can I accept that...
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
Oh, I am so sorry.
No me, I am so sorry...
Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
Okay, Im sorry.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but
I-I am so sorry, Ill go.
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Oh.
I-I wasnt in that.
All right, Ill leave.
My beds so boring.
Okay, I dont know what to do anymore.
Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
Estelle said I didn't get it.
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
Were never gonna find anybody.
Oh, Im so sorry.
Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
You do attract some stinkers.
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
You missed youre chance!
Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.
So, do you think you can forgive me?
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
I know honey, Im sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
No. No, you're not a loser.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
This-this happened when my grandfather died.
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Were probably too old to do that now.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
I dont want them to move to a
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
We're sorry.
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
I know. Im sorry.
Well, I lost.
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Terry already hired that girl over there.
Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Im sorry, I do that.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
