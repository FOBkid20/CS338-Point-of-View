Shell drive us totally crazy.
Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.
Ew.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
Im an idiot.
Uh, this is too weird.
Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this.
Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
No!
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?
Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
That would be no.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
No, I dont.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre
But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?
Well he made Rachel cry!
Why did I have to start working out again?
It tastes like feet!
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Arghh!!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
Then why are you smoking?
Ugh!
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
No.
Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
I think I know whats going on here.
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
Who cares? I repel women.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Oh, ew!
Oh, come on.
I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but
I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
I mean,... how needy is that?
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Oh, that is so sick.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Oh my good God.
Ugh!
Whats that smell?
Ewww!
Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
The spitter.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Okay, hating this.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
You are both idiots.
The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
You have no idea how loud they are!
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place.
You're one to talk.
Ugh!!
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
No thanks, Mom!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
So, rocks.
Oh, classy.
Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Great, now he's waving back.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.
No!
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
You freak.
Oh-oh, you lie.
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts
Ugh.  Ross!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
That's not what we're gonna do!
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
You're making a big mistake here.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Well you should be embarrassed.
How rude.
Ugh.
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!
Thats weird!
Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
Okay, whatever.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
My parents will be so happy.
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Tell me about it, huh?  Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica!  Ewwuck!
Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.
Nothing. Its just old and dingy, thats all.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah.
Thats a little more than I wanted to see.
Because its weird!
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that
Oh no.
What's with her?
Dude, you are sick.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
That sucks!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Makes me wanna puke!
Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
Eww!
We are bad people.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
No, I dont think well be doing that.
Were not gonna do that.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?
Yeah!
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Ohh, get a room.
I know. Use it.
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Nah!
Great. It's gym class all over again.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Hes taking off her coat!
Oh, this is just terrible.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
I'm outta here.
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
And yet, were still poking him.
Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.
Aww, I don't want to see that!
You two will have very hairy children.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
It's worse than the thumb!
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
Yeah, I don't like that word.
Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
Ugh!
Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Does that smell bother you?
No, it’s worse than that.
It’s wrong.
Why am I not surprised?
Wash your hands!!!
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Uh-huh.
This place is so overpriced.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself.
Oh damnit!
Noo.
Sells drugs to kids.
She sells drugs to kids.
Okay lady, you're out of here.
No!
YeahNo!!
I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...
Okay, goodbye...
That, that's what's stupid.
Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
: Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of
I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
Oh my God. He threw up?
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Chandler please!
No!!
No!
And shame on you!
And shame on all of you!
Youre disgusting!
Especially you  with that!
I mean look at him, look at you,
Oh my God!
All right.
...Yeah, they were gross.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
I officially give up.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
I don't care if you    are my brother.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Oh, please!
But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
It's ugh!
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
What the hells a matter with you?
We hate that guy.
Yeah. Hate him.
...No, we hate him.
Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much crap?
I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
No, no!
What are you crazy?!
No-o-o!  No way!
I ate a bug.
Its so annoying.
You bug me.
Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here!
Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It made me nuts.
