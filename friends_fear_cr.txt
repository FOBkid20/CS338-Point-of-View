R: Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!

C: Oh no!
R: Wait!

C: Oh hey, Ross.
R: Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.

C: Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!

C: No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
R: Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?

C: Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?
R: Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.

C: I can, I can see that.
R: Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.

C: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
R: She is gonna hate me.

C: Okay?
R: I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.

C: Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
R: Joey, I am scared to death about this.

C: Joey, I am scared to death about this.
R: But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.

C: Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
R: I was scared of telling you.

C: Why is Ross doing that?
R: DANGER

C: Oh my God! I love him!
R: You'd better act surprised.

C: I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
R: No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!

C: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
R: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!

R: Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.

C: Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
R: There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.

C: Sup? Sup dude?
R: Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.

C: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
R: You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.

C: What was with the dishes?
R: Oh, uh..

C: Oh, uh..
R: I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?

C: I'm not moving out.
R: You'd tell me if you were moving out right

C: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
R: Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think youre kidding.

C: Ive got some bad news.
R: What?

C: Oh.
R: Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?

C: No.  This is my red sweater.
R: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.

C: Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
R: Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?

C: What did you just say?
R: F-hah.... flennin....

C: Oh good.
R: Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.

C: So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.
R: Its-its too soon.

C: What?
R: You tell her Jack, I cant do it.

C: Yeah that works.
R: They-they-they can smell fear.

C: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
R: What did, what did he say?

C: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
R: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?

C: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
R: Don't say it.

C: All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
R: Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?

C: Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
R: I cant watch!

C: Arent you scared?
R: Terrified.

C: Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
R: Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.

C: Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
R: Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?

C: Dude, this isnt funny!
R: What am I gonna do?!

C: Joey, do you have a minute?
R: Dude, what am I gonna

C: Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
R: Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!

C: Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
R: Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.

C: So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
R: Oh no, youll have to come.

C: Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
R: No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.

C: I didnt know he could get me fired!
R: What am I going to do?

C: Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
R: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.

C: Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
R: Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.

C: Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
R: Oh God...

C: I'll be right there, Bernice.
R: Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay?

C: Oh.
R: Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it on the lose? Is it watching me?

C: Can I help you?
R: Uh-oh.

C: Hello.
R: Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im

C: Oh-oh, thats a risky little game!
R: Are you really gonna do this?

C: No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.
R: It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool.

C: Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.
R: Okay, here goes.

C: You did!
R: Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.

C: Oh? Really? Thats what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
R: No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love Rachel.

C: Jam.
R: Oh Joey don't!

C: So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
R: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.

C: All right.
R: I'm not fine. Here she comes.

C: Oh God, I'm sorry!
R: I did not mean to touch thatI mean

C: Stupid closet full of bugs!
R: Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa!!

C: Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah.
R: I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

C: I know.
R: If we broke up, and I lost you...

C: Hello?  No she cant come to the phone right now.  Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
R: Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!

C: I can tell her how I feel.
R: Just uh, just stand up straight.

C: Just uh, just stand up straight.
R: Take a couple deep breaths.

C: Take a couple deep breaths.
R: Look confident.

C: Joey? Whats up?
R: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.

C: Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
R: All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong.

C: I dont believe this!!
R: Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.

C: I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
R: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.

C: A small puff of air, now come on!
R: Sure, now Im scared.

C: No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
R: Yeah, but I dont wanna die!

C: Oh uh, Im sorry.
R: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!

C: I know, that’s why I said again!
R: Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.

C: Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
R: All right. Did everyone get out okay?

C: Ohh. What is this?
R: No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!

C: Hot dog?
R: Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.

C: Yes it is.
R: How do you know?

C: Who?
R: I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?

C: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
R: But if...

C: Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
R: Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.

C: Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
R: Uh-oh.

C: Okay, quick and painful.
R: Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.

C: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
R: Ooh, now you lost me.

C: No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
R: No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!

C: Well, they go into the chipper.
R: Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!

C: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
R: Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.

C: May I see it?
R: Um, no.

C: Oh.
R: Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.

C: Electrical plans for the building.
R: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?

C: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
R: Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!

C: Dont you look at her you sick bastard!
R: Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!

C: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
R: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!

C: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
R: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.

C: Ahh!
R: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?

C: This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!
R: No, dont look directly at them!

C: Mom no, come on! Thank you.
R: Just hear me out!

C: Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you.
R: This is a freaky place.

C: Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend.
R: Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?

C: Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.
R: Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?

C: Yeah.
R: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?

C: Thanks.
R: Kinda... spooky without any lights.

C: What?! Its 6 oclock!
R: Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!

C: Ugh!
R: I dont know what Im going to do!

C: Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!
R: Well, I-I said yes.

C: Chandler, you have an assistant right?
R: Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!

C: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
R: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'

C: So have you called her yet?
R: Let her know I like her?

C: It's Danny.
R: Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.

C: Im sorry.
R: Does it?

C: Theres no way to do this without her?
R: Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.

C: What are you going to tell her?
R: Oh God.

C: No! Joey, youre going to be great!
R: But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology!

C: Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name!
R: But the auditions in a couple hours and I dont even understand the game.

C: Okay.
R: No-no-no-no!

C: You told her before you told us?
R: Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys?

C: Listen, drama critics theyre nothing but, but people who couldnt make it as actors. You know what you should do?
R: Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?

C: Wait uh, listen.
R: I-I, I have to tell you something.

C: I-I, I have to tell you something.
R: Umm, Ive been thinking, Im just gonna come out and say it.

C: Umm, Ive been thinking, Im just gonna come out and say it.
R: Okay?

C: What did you say?
R: I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."

C: Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!
R: Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say.

C: Oh, okay.
R: Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.

C: But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it.
R: But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.

C: But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.
R: So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.

C: No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
R: Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.

C: You fell asleep?
R: But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?

C: Tulsa is heaven!
R: Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there!

C: Chandler, I…
R: No no no!

C: Smell familiar?
R: Oh no.

C: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
R: Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.

C: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
R: Yes!

C: Im not?
R: Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.

C: Dont worry, Im brave!
R: I am brave!

C: I am brave!
R: II am brave!

C: II am brave!
R: No-no-no-no!!

C: Oh, thank you. Youre welcome.
R: No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.

C: Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at
R: Oh no-no, I cant do that.

C: Now what is Fabutec?
R: Okay, all right dont judge me to much.

C: I know!!
R: God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do that?

C: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
R: Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,

C: Yeah, okay, Scott!
R: And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.

C: Why did you take the shower curtain down?
R: That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.

C: I have a bone to pick with you.
R: Uh-oh.

C: Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
R: What am I going to do?

C: All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
R: I don't know you guys.

C: All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.
R: No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.

C: You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
R: I-I'm sorry! Sorry.

C: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
R: You are really frightening me.

C: You are really frightening me.
R: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?

C: All right, honey, time to start pushing.
R: But they're not here yet!

C: I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
R: Oh, god.

C: Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
R: No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou

C: You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
R: Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and

C: No-no its not!
R: I dont want to lose you!

C: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
R: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

C: Are you all right?
R: Uhh… I think I just got engaged.

C: Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
R: Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....

C: I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
R: Bob?

C: She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
R: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.

C: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
R: No that could kill her.

C: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
R: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

C: Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.
R: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.

C: So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
R: Oh no

C: I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
R: This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
