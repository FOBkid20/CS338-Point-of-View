C: What?
R: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

C: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
R: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

C: The point is I...
R: I don't need this right now, OK.

C: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
R: Fine.

C: Fine.
R: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

C: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
R: Good.

C: Good.
R: Good.

C: Yeah, no one talks like that!
R: Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!

C: Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
R: Hey, I'm more cop than you two!

C: Oh what, you-you want both of them?
R: Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!

C: These
R: Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

C: Okay. You ready to push again?
R: I already had a baby. Leave me alone.

C: Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
R: I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.

C: Bob!
R: Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!

C: Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im over it already.
R: Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass.

C: Yeah, we're better off without them.
R: And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club!

C: Porsche.
R: This is totally your fault!

C: This is totally your fault!
R: My fault?! You threatened the judge!

C: My fault?! You threatened the judge!
R: Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!

C: What are you gonna do?
R: Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure!

C: Rachel said that!
R: Well Rachels not here!

C: Come on, come on.
R: Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.

C: Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.
R: This is all your fault.

C: This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?
R: My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.

C: No no no, believe me.
R: No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?

C: That she left you for another woman that likes women?
R: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...

C: Youve got it.
R: Cookie, now you can punch him!

C: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
R: Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.

C: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
R: Yeah, right.  Sure!

C: I never meant for you to find out!
R: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.

C: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
R: That is not true!

C: That is not true!
R: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?

C: Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed.
R: Fine!

C: Fine!
R: Ill do it without you!

C: Ill do it without you!
R: I dont need you or anybody else!

C: I dont need you or anybody else!
R: Im gonna make it on my own!

C: Im gonna make it on my own!
R: Youll see!!

C: I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!
R: You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!

C: Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant.
R: Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!

C: What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people.
R: Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?

C: Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
R: Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!

C: Oh, wait-wait-wait
R: You tell them to wait!

C: Emily.
R: Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!

C: I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
R: Nevermind!

C: How, how is this my fault?
R: Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.

C: Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
R: Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.

C: Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
R: You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?

C: You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
R: You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.

C: You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
R: Oh, I'm threatened by you?

C: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
R: Yes.

C: Yes.
R: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!

C: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!
R: Get in here.

C: My god, you guys, I don't believe you.
R: There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.

C: There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
R: So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!

C: What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
R: No, but you're questioning my method!

C: No, but you're questioning my method!
R: No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?!

C: Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
R: Your other student, was you!

C: Your other student, was you!
R: Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!

C: Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
R: Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!

C: Right here!
R: Here!

C: Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and
R: Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play

C: "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
R: Oh, fine! Take his side!

C: Oh, fine! Take his side!
R: And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!

C: And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!
R: Hey!

C: Oh sure.
R: Im pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever youre ready.  And youre the father by the waybut you got that

R: And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'

C: Phoebe, dont get upset!
R: OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go!

C: Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
R: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.

C: You love me!
R: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

C: Hi, this is Monica from the plane?
R: Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5   That is their old number!

C: Why cant I find that?
R: Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!

C: Okay, go left. Left! Left!
R: Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!

C: Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
R: I mean, enough of the silliness!

C: I mean, enough of the silliness!
R: Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!

C: Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
R: What a wank!

C: What a wank!
R: Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.

C: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
R: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.

C: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
R: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.

C: Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
R: !

C: Chandler that's crazy!
R: If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!

C: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
R: Okay, good bye!

C: Im in the middle
R: Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!

C: Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!
R: Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!

C: Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
R: Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?

C: Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
R: Its not like, I havent any opportunities.

C: And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
R: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.

C: Thanks Mon!
R: Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.

C: Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
R: Damnit!

C: So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
R: Fine, Im mentally unstable.

C: Uh yes, heroin and crack.
R: Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!

C: Do you really?
R: No, I dont see it!

C: Hey!
R: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.

C: Umm, Gene.
R: Its Clint. Its Clint!

C: No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
R: You know, this isn't fair.

C: You know, this isn't fair.
R: What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?

C: Huh?
R: Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?

C: Okay wait!
R: You listen to me!

C: You listen to me!
R: You listen to me!

C: Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!
R: Im next!

C: Im next!
R: Its my turn!

C: Its my turn!
R: Its only fair!

C: Its only fair!
R: And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!

C: And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!
R: Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!

C: Uh Rach
R: Go get back on that case honey!

C: Sit.
R: Sit!

C: When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
R: That cup is mine!

C: That cup is mine!
R: No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!

C: Oh.
R: What?! You got us evicted!!

C: What?! You got us evicted!!
R: I told you not to go down there!

C: Well he made Rachel cry!
R: Rachel always cries!

C: Rachel always cries!
R: Thats not true!

C: All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
R: Go!!

C: I cant remember which sister.
R: You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!

C: Whats wrong with you?
R: Nothing!

C: This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
R: No way!

C: Why did I have to start working out again?
R: Damn you 15s!

C: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
R: Shhhh!

C: Yeah?
R: Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!

C: Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!
R: I hate you!

C: I hate you!
R: You ruined my life!

C: That's always fun to be.
R: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!

C: I warned you...
R: Who is being loud?

C: I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
R: Ohh, well, this is just perfect!

C: Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
R: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.

C: Really?
R: Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.

C: Alright, well, be good, I love you.
R: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.

C: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
R: Really stupid.

C: Are we okay now?
R: Yeah. No. No...

C: The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
R: When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.

C: Oh yeah, that's right!
R: I'm not a dropper!

C: It is.
R: Isn't!

C: Which is why
R: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?

C: Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
R: Get up!

C: A doctor at this hospital?
R: Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?

C: Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
R: Stupid, useless Canadian money!

C: After she gave me that big speech?!
R: She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?

C: She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
R: I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!

C: What?!
R: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?

C: Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
R: Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.

C: Frannie was the one who found your
R: That bitch!

C: Monica! What
R: Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!

C: Hi Frannie, congratulations.
R: You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!

C: What could I have possibly done?!
R: Stuart!

C: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
R: Yeah, get out!

C: Yeah, get out!
R: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!

C: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
R: Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?

C: Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
R: Come on, wussies!

C: Honey, honey, people are looking.
R: I dont care!  I dont care!!

C: Im missin picture time?!
R: Yknow she has a face Ross!

C: And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
R: Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?

C: Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
R: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.

C: It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
R: : Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!

C: No. I...
R: Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.

C: I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
R: Is that too much to ask after six years?!

C: Hey!
R: I did not cry my eyes out!!

C: Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
R: You completely stole my answer!

C: Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
R: Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!

C: Would
R: Are you just repeating what I'm saying?

C: Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
R: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!

C: The Hardy boys?
R: Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?

C: Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?
R: I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?

C: Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
R: You cant marry him!

C: Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
R: No!

C: Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits.
R: They are completely differentOkay!

C: Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
R: Tag!

C: Tag!
R: Im serious!

C: Im serious!
R: This isnt funny!

C: This isnt funny!
R: Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!

C: Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
R: Yes I did! And I put a little

C: Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
R: Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.

C: You wanna go down to the office right now?
R: No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.

C: What do you mean?
R: Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!

C: Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
R: Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!

C: Thank you, Happy Holidays.
R: Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!

C: Hes not here right now.
R: Oh, youre kidding me!

C: Ask again later.
R: Later is not good enough.

C: Ask again later.
R: What the hell!

C: What the hell!
R: This is broken!

C: This is broken!
R: It-it is broken!

C: And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
R: Shh!

C: Shh!
R: Were trying to think!

C: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
R: This woman's living my life.

C: What?
R: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!

C: No, I meant with the dropper over here.
R: Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm

C: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
R: We said seven!

C: We said seven!
R: We said six!

C: The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
R: Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"

C: Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
R: You, get out of my shop!

C: Well, what did he do?
R: He went out with my wife!

C: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
R: Thats my wife!!! Get out!

C: Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
R: No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.

R: Oh yes there is!

C: Oh yes there is!
R: What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!

C: What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
R: That was an accident! And so were you.

C: That was an accident! And so were you.
R: Well, at least Im not a murderer!

C: She wants
R: Oh my God! If you say that one more time,

C: Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
R: Fine!

C: Fine!
R: Fine!

C: Fine!
R: But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!

C: But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
R: ...I can begin to trust you again.

C: ...I can begin to trust you again.
R: Does that seem like something you can do.

C: Does that seem like something you can do.
R: Does it?!

C: Does it?!
R: !

C: What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
R: Joey, get out of the fridge.

R: You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!

C: You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
R: Now let it go!

C: Now let it go!
R: The joke sucks!

C: Its your joke.
R: Is not.

R: Then don't touch one!!

C: So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
R: Oh, DAMN IT!

C: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
R: Well, up yours too!

C: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
R: You fell asleep!!

C: You fell asleep!!
R: There was no kangaroo!

C: He fell asleep too!
R: Be mad at him!

C: Nobody!
R: Nobody respects the bucket!

C: You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
R: Look!

C: Look!
R: Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?

C: Thats a hernia.
R: Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!

C: Or we could throw you both in
R: Ok, gentlemen!

C: Ok, gentlemen!
R: Please!

C: Please!
R: Aren't we a little old for this?

C: What's going on with you?
R: I got no sleep last night!

C: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
R: Chandler, we have talked about this.

C: Chandler, we have talked about this.
R: You are not supposed to give people advice!

C: I
R: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!

C: Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
R: So Ross, what your problem?

C: Eh-whExcuse me?
R: Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?

C: What?
R: Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.

C: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
R: Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.

C: Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
R: Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!

C: Huh?
R: Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!

C: Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.
R: It doesnt say that in the script.

C: Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
R: Dont touch him!

C: Okay?
R: Stupid!

C: I cant believe it!
R: God!

C: I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
R: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?

C: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
R: You had no

C: You had no
R: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.

C: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
R: But I told you, I didnt have the time!

C: But I told you, I didnt have the time!
R: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.

C: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
R: Wh, Ross what do you want from me?

C: Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
R: You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

C: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
R: Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!

C: You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
R: Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?

C: Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
R: You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!

C: I call it!!
R: What?! No! It was my idea!

C: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
R: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!

C: Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
R: Damn!

C: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
R: Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!

C: Oh sure, go with the sissy.
R: Jason is not a sissy!

C: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
R: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.

C: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
R: Yuh-huh!

C: Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
R: Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.

C: Im not gonna marry Chandler!
R: Not after this!

C: Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.

C: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
R: Nobody sees the king!

C: You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.

R: What do I have to do to get some service?!

C: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
R: Go!

C: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
R: I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.

C: Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
