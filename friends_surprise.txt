What are you talkin about? I never left you! Youve always been my agent!
Really?!
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars.
Im sorry, who are you?
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait!  Did you write this?
Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought. Youreyoure so young.
What?
Oh shoot!
What?! They took mine to give to you!
Why would they take away our keys?
Uh, what?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Chandlers gone again!
We got another one!
Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children.
How scary is that?
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong.
'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!
Chandler's a girl!
We have our babies?
Ohh!
Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
Oh just say it Kyle!
Rachel said that!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
What are you doing here?
That she left you?
With Carol?  Oh.
So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.
Oh no! Why?
Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Well, now I do!!
What?!
What? I didn't say anything.
Jody!
Oh. Oh my God.
Why?!
Oh my God, who is it?!
As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
What?! Well he never said that to me!
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
So, eight days late huh?
Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning!
Really?!
Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Well, this is ironic.
What?!
What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people.
Ow!
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Ah!  Oh.
Oh!!
How, how is this my fault?
Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?!
Wow... Wow!
..Excuse me?
Joey, uh-
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Hey!
You made pancakes?
Oh my good God.
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework.
Are you kidding?!
Did you just make that up?
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad!
Really?!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
We do?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?!
Really?
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
Yeah? Wow! Yknow, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No. Really?
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
You do?

How do you know about that story?!
Some guy!!

I licked my arm, what?
What did you just do?
Aww!
Ohh!!
My apothecary table!!!
What?!
Ross, where did you get this?!
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Whats this?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Hey!
Ooohhhh!!
Ahhhh!!
Hey, my Fathers house does that!
Oh whats that honey?
What?
Oh, you want a little cousin?
Look!
What?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
You really think so?

This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does!
Ooh!

Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Ohh!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Oh my God!

Whats fish hooking?
Bumpy?
Oh!
My God!
Excuse me?

Have you really done this before?
Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
Really? A purse?
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Chandler that's crazy!
We're in a relationship?
Oh God!
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.

There's something new in the bowl.
Oh my God, what happened?
Ross's what?
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah! Im sorry Im getting all flingy.
Oh, what? What was it?
It worked!
Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, youve waited
Yknow what? You are right?!
Oh my God! Monica!
Who, Josh?
What, he doesnt like Josh?
Oh no!
Wait!
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
What?
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Really?!
Oh, youre switching apartments?
She is?
Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
Wait a minute!
What?!
Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.
Oh right!
Right!
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!

Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Oh my God.
Why, what happened?
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
Are you kidding?
Are you intrigued?
Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
Good day for married people huh?
What?
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
You chipped in?!
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
No!
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Wow, you guys, this is big.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Whoa, for like months?
No!
Come on you gotta have one!
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!
Oh my God!
Oh, are you sure?
Really?
What? What can't you do?
She really said that?
'Tonight' tonight?
You're kidding.
What?!
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
What?
Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
What?
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Oh myOh good God!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Who? Me the attacker?
No-noReally?!
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
So, thats it?
Why?
What?! You said he was sweet!
What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
There you are!
There you are!
Oh hey!
Canceled?!
Like theyre taking it off the air?
Were not even shootin them anymore?!!
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!
What?
No, no, no. What was that?
If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Really?
A doctor at this hospital?
No!
Oh my God.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Here?! Now?!
What happened?
Really?
Dude! Dude!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
After she gave me that big speech?!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
What?!
Monica! What
Why?!
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Yeah?
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
What?! Over a stupid room!
Shut-out!!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
Together? Like-like to people?
Oh my God.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
!
Ahhhh!!
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
What is it?!
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing?
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Okay, who are you?
Oh my God! Joey!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
Oh my God.
Its Joey!
Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?
Theres a dude?
Who? Who is it?
Oh my God! I know who the father is
Oh my God, youre back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
No!
Okay!
Okay!
Whos that?
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
What do you mean?
Uh, what was that?
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Whoa!
What is that?!
It's nine o'clock in the morning!
What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Really?
Really?!
Are you sure?
What about
Surprise!!!
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Really?!
Really? To what?
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And
Thats a mailman! Thats
This is going in your book?
What?! Excuse me!
What the? What
Really?
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
What, now?
I dont get it!
What?!
Okay.  See?! I told ya!
Really?!
Ohh!
Really?!
What?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Oh!
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
What?!
Well, what did he do?
Joey!
Yeah?
Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
Really?!
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
What?!
Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
Hey!
Hey!
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
Fish!
Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
Hot coffee!!!
Hey!
My God! What happened to you?
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Say what?
Oh that was a real person?!
I-I-Im leaving the show?
Who told you that?
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Wow!
Really?!
Oh, really?
Thats crazy.
Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Wow.
Relieved?
No?
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
What is that?
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!
You know it?
Theyre not listening too me?
Are you kidding?
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
What?! Oh.
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
What?! Are you crazy?
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
What?!
Wow! Fortunately she has a
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
!
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!
Oh Willies still alive!
Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
My duties?  All right.
Really?!
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
No way!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What, what, what?!
What?!
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
What are you doing here?
Everybody!!
You liked it? You really liked it?
Look!
What?!
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
Really?!
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Whats with all this sand?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.
How does she do that?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
What's going on with you?
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
How can you not know which one?
You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Really!?
Really?
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
What?  Why?
Eh-whExcuse me?
Daddy!
Ooooohh!
Was it...?
"Ooo," what?
Oh!
The actress!
So what are you gonna do?
Oh! Oop!

Oh my God!
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
What happened?
Oh my God!
Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?
Hey!
My sweater!
Ive been looking for this for like a month!
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!
Huh?
Hello?   Its the deli again!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
Since then?!
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Yeah, that's it?

Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King!
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!

Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh
Joey! You didnt even know her!
Okay!
Ah-ah!!
Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right?
I cant believe it!
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Theres gravy?

Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
What surprise party?
Looks like I was second to last.
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
What?
What the hell is this?!
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Oh my!
What?
What are you talking about?!
What?
No?
Well then, what is it?!
Really?
So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married.
What?!
Why?!!
You do?
You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Its happened to you?
Well, whatd you do?
Come on man, really how old?!
And they knew about it?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Hey! You cant go back there!
Oh my God.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
And now you want that money back.
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
I believe I read that somewhere!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Thats Carol with your son!
Oh, Alice, hi!
Oh my God, who died on this?!
Really. What?
Why the Post?
Oh, you didnt see the Post?
Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
Yeah?
Rach, are you okay?
AhWhoa!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
What?!
What?!
Me and Chandler?!
A test?!!
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
Really?
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
You cook naked?
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
You knew about that?
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
Oh my God!
You actually broke her watch?
Ooh, steer clear of you.
What are you doing with the lamp?
What is going on?
Ross!
Wow! Uhhow are you?
Oh youre serious. Sure!
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
Really? Are you sure?
Come on!
Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God!
What?!
Did he tell you?
You don't trust him?
There are?
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
You just told me that he hates marriage!
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Why?
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
What?! What else did he say?
But! Dont you have to give him his money back?
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Well usually...yeah!
Ohhh!!!!
Oh, look at the little cat!

Really? I dont
What musician?
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
Oh my god.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Who are those people?
Got me.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
What the?!
Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
What?!
Yeah? Really? No ones home?
Phoebe!
You are having a party tonight??
You do that every year??
Who's this from?
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
It was like months ago.
Oh!
I can't believe he remembered!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
What did you just say?
Oh.... my God.
Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie?
Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Are you serious?  Oh my God.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
A-ha!!!
Excuse me?
Do I know you?
Ross!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!
What?!
I know!
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No. I think you misunderstood what
Oh my God.
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
But my apartment!
What?! It is?!
What? Guys, I'm not.
Waitressing?
Oh, my god.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
Why?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Oh, really.
When did that happen to you?!
That was unbelievable!
They're brother and sister!!!
What picture?!
What?! They wanted a scary story!
What?
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Oh my God! Thats David!
Oh my God!
Phoebe?
David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia?
Ohh.
Why?
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
I'm sorry?
Oh yeah? When?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Did you go home and change?
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
What? We could do it!
Oh, I embarrass you?
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?
Thats why you broke up with me?
Oh my God!
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Oh! You have a window!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Janice!
You're not... gone?
Oh!
So did you do it?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Really?
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
What?!
Oh my God, so do I!
I knew it, wow!!
Hey! Me too!
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Really?  My God, hes really cute.
Phoebe, Im engaged!
What?!
Uh, tiny!

I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
They had to have that specially made?!
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
Oh, really?!

The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?

Hey! Youre a good dancer!
Really?
Who?  Is that your sister?
My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.

Instead of...?
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Oh my god.
What?
Oh!

But, he told me over the phone.
Thats weird.
Hey! Look who I found!
What?
This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!

The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Oh my God Ross!!
There he is! There he is!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Yeah?
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here.

Really?! So this has happened to you?
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
Whoa! Are you okay?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.

Look Julio, someone left their book here.

Are we really in Montreal?!
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Why?

I can't believe you did that!
Still?

Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
I made a promise that--Oh hey!
You're nose is bleeding!
Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Ohh!
Okay!
Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."

Wow!
She is kicking so much!
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!

Are you jealous?
What?
Huh.
I cant believe you came back.
You missed the exit!
My God, what were you thinking about?
I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
God!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
What?! You kissed!
Really?!
Youre kidding right?
Well thats a full cup!

Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!
Why?
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Oh!
Oh, I can't believe it!
What? What?

Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Oh God.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?

How did you know about that?!

Really?!
Oh! Its you.  Hi.
Wh-what?! Why?!
You're kidding right?

You guys are messing with me, right?
