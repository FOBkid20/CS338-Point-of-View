C: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
R: Okay, who are you?

C: Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
R: Phoebe!

C: Phoebe!
R: Why?! Why cant she marry me?!

C: Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
R: Oh my God.

C: Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!
R: Its Joey!

C: Its Joey!
R: Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?

C: Ohh I wonder if that dude.
R: Theres a dude?

C: Yeah.
R: Who? Who is it?

C: The guy left this.
R: Oh my God! I know who the father is

C: Oh my God, youre back!
R: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!

C: I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
R: No!

C: They are completely differentOkay!
R: Okay!

C: Okay!
R: Okay!

C: Hey, what do you want to drink?
R: Whos that?

C: Sure.
R: Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?

C: Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
R: If this is your idea of sexy talk?

C: Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
R: Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!

C: See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
R: What do you mean?

C: Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
R: Uh, what was that?

C: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
R: You talked to him. Are you crazy?

C: Thank you, I need that.
R: Whoa!

C: Whoa!
R: What is that?!

C: What is that?!
R: It's nine o'clock in the morning!

C: Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
R: What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!

C: What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
R: Really?

C: No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
R: Really?!

C: Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
R: Are you sure?

C: Okay we have to do something about your breath.
R: What about

C: Okay.
R: Surprise!!!

C: Yeah, were done.
R: Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?

C: Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
R: Really?!

C: I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
R: Really? To what?

C: Man,
R: Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And

C: Chandler, theres a guy right over there.
R: Thats a mailman! Thats

C: You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
R: This is going in your book?

C: Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
R: What?! Excuse me!

C: Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
R: What the? What

C: I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
R: Really?

C: Come on, two on one.
R: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!

C: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
R: What, now?

C: Hey!
R: I dont get it!

C: This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
R: What?!

C: All right, you have yourself a deal.
R: Okay.  See?! I told ya!

C: Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just
R: Really?!

C: Really?!
R: Ohh!

C: Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
R: Really?!

C: This woman's living my life.
R: What?

C: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
R: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.

C: Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
R: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!

C: I feel violated. And not in a good way.
R: How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!

C: Go!!
R: What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!

C: Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
R: Oh!

C: Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
R: What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?

C: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
R: Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!

C: I know what time you said.
R: What?!

C: You, get out of my shop!
R: Well, what did he do?

C: He went out with my wife!
R: Joey!

C: Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
R: Yeah?

C: I know.
R: Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?

C: Ohhh!
R: Why are we in bed together?

C: Yeah.
R: Really?!

C: Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
R: I thought I was making him filet mignon?

C: And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
R: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.

C: Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
R: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?

C: Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
R: Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!

C: Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
R: What?!

C: Gunther, I quit.
R: Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?

C: Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
R: Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!

C: But in very different ways.
R: Hey!

C: Hey!
R: Hey!

C: I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
R: Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?

C: Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
R: Fish!

C: Okay, its coffee.
R: Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!

C: Its-its hot
R: Hot coffee!!!

C: Yeah
R: Hey!

C: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
R: My God! What happened to you?

C: No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
R: Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?

C: Oh, my baby!
R: That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?

C: Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
R: Say what?

C: No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
R: Oh that was a real person?!

C: An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
R: I-I-Im leaving the show?

C: I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
R: Who told you that?

C: Oh uh, one of the writers.
R: Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?

C: Hi!
R: Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?

C: Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
R: Wow!

C: Yeah.
R: Really?!

C: Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
R: Oh, really?

C: Thats just the way it is.
R: Thats crazy.

C: I know!
R: Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?

C: Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
R: Wow, that was kinda brutal.

C: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
R: Relieved?

C: !
R: No?

C: A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
R: What the hell happened on that beach?!

C: Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
R: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?

C: Oh wow! Im free for her!
R: Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!

C: Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
R: What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.

C: All right, all right.
R: What is that?

C: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
R: Oh my God! Calling from Rome!

C: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
R: You know it?

C: Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
R: Theyre not listening too me?

C: Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
R: Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!

C: Then don't touch one!!
R: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!

C: Wow! Skates!
R: Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?

C: I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
R: What?! Oh.

C: Hang on buddy!
R: Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?

C: I sure did.
R: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.

C: The physical act of love.
R: What?! Are you crazy?

C: What?! Are you crazy?
R: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?

C: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
R: Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!

C: No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
R: Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!

C: Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
R: What?!

C: Wow! Fortunately she has a
R: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!

C: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
R: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!

C: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
R: !

C: Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
R: Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.

C: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
R: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?

C: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
R: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?

C: Were not gonna be
R: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?

C: Wheres Chandler?
R: Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!

C: Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
R: Oh Willies still alive!

C: Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
R: Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!

C: No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this
R: Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the

C: So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
R: My duties?  All right.

C: All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
R: Really?!

C: Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
R: But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?

C: You know? Forget it!
R: No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?

C: Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
R: No way!

C: Um-mm, yeah right!
R: Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!

C: Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
R: What, what, what?!

C: What, what, what?!
R: What?!

C: Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
R: He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!

C: Hi!
R: What are you doing here?

C: Ameri-can. Y'know its a
R: Everybody!!

C: Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
R: You liked it? You really liked it?

C: Im so sorry!
R: Look!

C: Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
R: What?!

C: But um, I dont think its anything serious.
R: This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!

C: Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
R: Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.

C: But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment.
R: Really?!

C: Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
R: Oh my God, wh-what happened?

C: Oy!!
R: Whats with all this sand?

C: I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
R: Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!

C: She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a
R: Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.

C: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
R: Oh! What what what! ...Hi.

C: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
R: What's going on with you?

C: It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
R: Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?

C: Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
R: How can you not know which one?

C: No, no, no, thats Dina.
R: You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!

C: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
R: Really!?

C: : Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
R: Really?

C: Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
R: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?

C: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
R: What?  Why?

C: So Ross, what your problem?
R: Eh-whExcuse me?

C: Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.
R: Daddy!

C: Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
R: Was it...?

C: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
R: "Ooo," what?

C: Uma Thurman.
R: Oh!

C: Oh!
R: The actress!

C: Thanks Rach.
R: So what are you gonna do?

C: Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?

R: What?! You totally get embarrassed!

C: Phoebe! Hi!
R: Oh my God!

C: Wow, you look unbelievable.
R: Yeah. What-what are you doing here?

C: Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
R: What happened?

C: It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
R: Oh my God!

C: Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water.
R: Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?

C: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
R: Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?

C: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
R: Since then?!

C: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
R: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.

C: Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
R: Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.

C: And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
R: Yeah, that's it?

C: Because we won our apartment back!

R: What?! Youre going out with her again!

C: Uh, Dana Keystone from college.

R: Okay!

C: I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
R: Ah-ah!!

C: Ah-ah!!
R: Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right?

C: Stupid!

R: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw

C: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!
R: What?

C: See, I see.... big passion in your future.
R: Really?

C: Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.

C: My surprise party!
R: What surprise party?

C: I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
R: Looks like I was second to last.

C: Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
R: And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"

C: Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
R: What?

C: Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.

R: What are you talking about?!

C: Umm, why don't you give
R: What?

C: Well that's not a third nipple.
R: No?

C: First of all, it's on your ass.
R: Well then, what is it?!

C: Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
R: Really?

C: I get it!
R: So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married.

C: No-no. We
R: What?!

C: Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all.
R: Why?!!

C: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
R: You do?

C: You do?
R: You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.

C: Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
R: When? Today? Some, not a lot.

C: Dont worry about that man, that happens.
R: Its happened to you?

C: Yeah! Once.
R: Well, whatd you do?

C: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
R: Come on man, really how old?!

C: Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
R: And they knew about it?

C: And they knew about it?
R: Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?

C: Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king.
R: Hey! You cant go back there!

C: Hey! You cant go back there!
R: Oh my God.

C: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
R: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?

C: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
R: And now you want that money back.

C: Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
R: What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!

C: Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
R: Why? Do you have the answers written on there?

C: I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
R: Okay, what is in here? Rocks?

C: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
R: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?

C: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
R: Thats Carol with your son!

C: Hi!
R: Oh, Alice, hi!

C: Im so glad you could come, cause Ive got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
R: Oh my God, who died on this?!

C: Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
R: Really. What?

C: Well stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
R: Why the Post?

C: Why the Post?
R: Oh, you didnt see the Post?

C: Im not asking you to go on a
R: Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.

C: Yeah, okay.
R: Yeah?

C: Yeah. Well, umm.....
R: Rach, are you okay?

C: Im sorry Im a little late.
R: AhWhoa!

C: Okay, you go!
R: My turn? What-what are you talking about?

C: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
R: What?!

C: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot.
R: What?!

C: All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
R: Me and Chandler?!

C: All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
R: A test?!!

C: Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him.
R: Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.

C: Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.
R: Really?

C: I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
R: Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!

C: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
R: You cook naked?

C: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
R: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.

C: Yuh-huh.
R: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?

C: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
R: This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?

R: You knew about that?

C: Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have

R: What?! What else did he say?

C: Okay.
R: But! Dont you have to give him his money back?

C: So?!
R: Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?

R: What musician?

C: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
R: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?

C: I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
R: Oh my god.

C: That little naked guy would be me.
R: Aww, look at the little thing.

C: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
R: Who are those people?

C: Who are those people?
R: Got me.

R: Oh!

C: Oh!
R: I can't believe he remembered!

C: I can't believe he remembered!
R: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.

C: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
R: I can't believe he did this.

C: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
R: What did you just say?

C: F-hah.... flennin....
R: Oh.... my God.

C: Wait, just a second.

R: Why?

C: Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
R: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.

C: Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
R: Oh, really.

C: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
R: When did that happen to you?!

C: Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
R: That was unbelievable!

C: I don't believe they're brother and sister.
R: They're brother and sister!!!

C: I found the picture!
R: What picture?!

C: Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
R: What?! They wanted a scary story!

C: Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
R: What?

C: You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
R: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?

C: Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
R: Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!

C: Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
R: Was it not pain-free?

C: Thank you.
R: Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!

R: Thats why you broke up with me?

C: No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
R: Oh my God!

C: Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
R: Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!

R: What? Mine arent tinted.

C: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.

C: Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, its his first time.
R: You dont say!

C: No...
R: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!

C: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
R: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?

C: Oh, God...
R: Should I not have told you?

C: Hi Phoebe Abott, Im your best friends daughter!
R: Youre Erwins daughter?!

C: No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here.  Lily, from high school. Remember?
R: Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?

C: Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
R: Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! Theres Frank.

C: Whoa ho.
R: I know!

C: Pheebs?
R: Flying a jet?

C: Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
R: Without me?!

C: Without me?!
R: My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.

C: Yeah.
R: They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!

C: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that
R: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.

C: So I'm thinking about you. So what?
R: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?

C: Stunning entertainment center. Fine,  fine Italian craftsmanship.
R: Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?

C: Oh no.
R: Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?

C: Nooo.
R: Oh. What do you do?

C: Hey!
R: What are you guys doing up?

C: Dude, you are sick.
R: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.

C: I mean, this is unbelievable.
R: I know. This is really, really huge.

C: Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
R: Really? Ive been dealing with Dr. Wells.

C: And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
R: Dr. Wells is a woman.

C: No.
R: Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?

C: Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
R: Are all the questions this personal?

C: Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.
R: Really?

C: No no, you don't have to fly back, really.
R: What do you mean this might be your only chance?

C: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
R: Oh yeah! With who?

C: Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
R: Oh my God!

C: Oh my God!
R: What?

C: What?
R: There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone.

C: Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
R: Wait, now, what am I doing again?

C: Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
R: Janice?

C: Janice?
R: Oh.... my.... God.

R: Oh my God! Oh my God!

C: Oh, this will be so much fun!
R: Hey!

C: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
R: Hey he's wearing a sweater.

C: We are bad people.
R: He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?

C: Okay, your highness.
R: Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!

C: I just called a friend of mine.
R: Yeah?

C: I think I may be able to book
R: Really?!

C: Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
R: What?!

C: So, youre like a zillionaire?
R: And youre our age. Youre our age.

C: Okay.
R: Youre our age!

C: Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
R: You do?

C: Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.
R: Brides magazines?

C: I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
R: Oh my God.

C: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
R: You didnt break up with that fireman?

C: He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
R: Wow!

C: Yeah me too, all night.
R: Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?

C: I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
R: Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker

C: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
R: Really? Me?

C: Yes.
R: Oh my god, are you kidding?

C: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
R: What?

C: Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
R: They put you in jail?

C: Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
R: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..

C: All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
R: What?!

C: But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
R: What?!

C: Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
R: Hey!

C: Hey!
R: Hey!

C: Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
R: Youre building a post office?

C: No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
R: Okay.  My word! Those are snug.

C: I cant seem to say goodbye.
R: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?

C: It was fine.
R: It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!

C: This ones from me.
R: Ahh!

C: It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
R: A scooter!

C: Thats funny, yeah!
R: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!

C: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
R: Really?

C: You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
R: What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!

C: Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
R: Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?

C: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
R: You al-you already had it?

C: And it kinda works out for the best.
R: What do you, what do you mean?

C: Oh,
R: I punched you...?

C: I punched you...?

R: You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.

C: Well thats the best part. Umm,
R: Wh-why is that the best part?

C: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.

R: Wow!

C: Wow!
R: What?

C: Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
R: Really?

C: We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?

R: That's patio furniture!

C: Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
R: Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"

C: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
R: Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!

C: No, Im sorry.
R: Wow! You guys really dont know anything!

C: Hey!
R: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!

C: And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
R: Ooh!

C: Ooh!
R: Theres no way to do this without her?

C: Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
