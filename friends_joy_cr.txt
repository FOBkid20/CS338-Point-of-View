R: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!

C: Oh well, give it time.
R: So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.

R: Uh-huh!

C: Uh-huh!
R: Wow! Cool!

C: Well, this has been fun.
R: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.

C: Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
R: Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.

C: All right, Ill do it just this once! But you cant tell anybody!
R: Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!

C: Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
R: Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!

C: So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
R: ...and live forever as a machine!

C: ...and live forever as a machine!
R: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?

C: Yeah, I gotta go.

C: Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
R: Ok, that'll be great!

C: Oh, great!
R: We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.

C: Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
R: All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"

C: And did he?
R: Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.

C: Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
R: I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.

C: Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
R: Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

C: Ahh.
R: Oh, would you look at that Monica?

C: Oh, would you look at that Monica?
R: I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.

C: Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
R: Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.

C: All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
R: No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!

C: All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
R: Thats right!

C: Thats right!
R: Cause Im a Tribbiani!

C: I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!
R: We can eat!

C: Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
R: Look at this!

C: Oh! You have a window!
R: Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...

C: Otherwise it's just cruel.
R: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.

R: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!

C: My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
R: Really helped speed the process along!

C: Did you make your deposit?
R: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!

C: Phoebe come here
R: Haha!

C: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
R: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...

C: Don't say it.
R: ...in love with you.

C: Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
