C: I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.
R: Shell drive us totally crazy.

C: These-these are beads of joy.
R: Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.

C: Its moving.
R: Ew.

C: I do know.
R: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

C: It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
R: Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!

C: Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
R: This is disgusting!

C: This is disgusting!
R: I'm not reading this!

C: Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
R: Im an idiot.

C: You know, I, you know, can't do this.
R: Uh, this is too weird.

C: What?! I wh-, whats wrong?
R: Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this.

C: Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him.
R: Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?

C: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
R: See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."

C: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
R: Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.

C: You know.... You don't know!
R: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?

C: What did you just do?
R: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?

C: You won't even taste it?
R: No!

C: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
R: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.

C: Thats funny.
R: Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?

C: Oh yes.
R: Well this doesnt even smell like opium.

C: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
R: That would be no.

C: All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
R: Please, I'm not going for anything.

C: Hmm.
R: Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a

C: But sadly I could not be enticed.
R: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!

C: Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
R: Ugh, can you believe that guy!

C: Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
R: Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!

C: Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
R: Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!

C: Booo!!
R: Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!

C: You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
R: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.

C: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
R: Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.

C: Ross's what?
R: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.

C: Well, youre not.
R: Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!

C: Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!
R: Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!

C: What, he doesnt like Josh?
R: No, I dont.

C: Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
R: To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre

C: Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
R: But you will always be the guy who peed on me.

C: ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
R: Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?

C: Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
R: No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.

C: Will the stable boy never get the princess??
R: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?

C: I told you not to go down there!
R: Well he made Rachel cry!

C: Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
R: Why did I have to start working out again?

C: then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
R: It tastes like feet!

C: Oh, oh! It's on again!
R: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.

C: Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
R: Arghh!!

C: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
R: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.

C: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
R: C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!

C: I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
R: Then why are you smoking?

C: Come on you gotta have one!
R: Ugh!

C: Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
R: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.

C: Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
R: I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.

C: I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
R: I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store

C: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
R: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.

C: I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
R: No.

C: Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
R: Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.

C: But
R: No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"

C: Just dont pick up your phone.
R: Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!

C: Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
R: Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill

C: Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
R: I think I know whats going on here.

C: You do?
R: Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.

C: So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
R: Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.

C: Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
R: Who cares? I repel women.

C: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
R: A hundred and forty-five pounds.

C: Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
R: Oh, come on.

C: What is it?!
R: I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.

C: Who? Who is it?
R: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but

C: Why do you want to see my hand?
R: I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.

C: Yeah.
R: Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.

C: Like what?
R: Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?

C: No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are
R: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!

C: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?
R: I mean,... how needy is that?

C: All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
R: Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

C: Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
R: A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!

C: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
R: Oh, that is so sick.

C: Oh, that is so sick.
R: I feel violated. And not in a good way.

C: Hi!
R: Oh my good God.

C: Oh my good God.
R: Ugh!

C: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
R: Whats that smell?

C: What stupid thing did you do?
R: Ewww!

C: Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
R: Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!

C: Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
R: Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.

C: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
R: Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!

C: Yeah, well, is that
R: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?

C: My God! What happened to you?
R: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?

C: Why, nobody good?
R: Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.

C: Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
R: The spitter.

C: Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
R: Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.

C: Save it.
R: Okay, hating this.

C: I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
R: That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.

C: All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
R: You are both idiots.

C: You are both idiots.
R: The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!

C: Whats the matter?
R: Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!

C: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
R: Oh my god. You are pure evil.

C: Why?
R: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.

C: So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
R: You have no idea how loud they are!

C: Thanks.
R: Ew! What is that? Something exploded!

C: Yeah.
R: Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am

C: Hello?  Eighth street deli?
R: Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place.

C: Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
R: You're one to talk.

C: Yeah.
R: Oh sure, go with the sissy.

C: No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
R: Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!

C: Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
R: I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.

C: Its not like we run in the same circles.
R: I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.

C: Okay?
R: Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.

C: Come on!
R: They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!

C: That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
R: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!

C: Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
R: No thanks, Mom!

C: So youre playing a little
R: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.

C: Come on man, really how old?!
R: Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!

C: Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
R: And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.

C: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
R: I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.

C: I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
R: That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.

C: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
R: So, rocks.

C: By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
R: Oh, classy.

C: How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Ill pay.
R: Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.

C: My turn? What-what are you talking about?
R: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.

C: Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
R: Great, now he's waving back.

C: Great, now he's waving back.
R: Man, we gotta do something about that guy.

C: Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
R: This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.

C: What kinda stuff?
R: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

C: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
R: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.

C: You knew about that?
R: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.

C: Im just taking it to be re-wired.
R: Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.

C: Wanna peek?
R: No!

C: Yes!
R: Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.

C: Okay, great.
R: You freak.

C: Yeah, maybe.
R: Oh-oh, you lie.

C: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
R: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.

C: Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.
R: You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!

C: What a sweet story.
R: Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.

C: Was it not pain-free?
R: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.

C: Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.
R: I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.

C: I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
R: Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?

C: No.
R: Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.

C: Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
R: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts

C: I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
R: Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."

C: Theyre all tourists.
R: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.

C: Ok, that'll be great!
R: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.

C: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
R: That's not what we're gonna do!

C: That's not what we're gonna do!
R: Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?

C: Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
R: You sound like a guy.

C: You sound like a guy.
R: No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."

C: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
R: You're making a big mistake here.

C: Well, you never told me how old you were.
R: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?

C: Oh god, oh god.
R: I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.

C: I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
R: I'm Joan Collins.

C: Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
R: Well you should be embarrassed.

C: Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
R: How rude.

C: The ring is gone!
R: Ugh.

C: Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
R: I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!

C: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
R: And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!

C: I know. They were mine.
R: Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!

C: No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
R: Thats weird!

C: And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
R: Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!

C: There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
R: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.

C: Hey! I
R: Okay, whatever.

C: Hey, listen, lady.......whoa.
R: Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.

C: The Celtics.
R: The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?

C: Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
R: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!

C: What do you think?
R: My parents will be so happy.

C: Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
R: Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

C: Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
R: Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!

C: Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
R: Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?

C: You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
R: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.

C: Wow! She is pretty, huh?
R: Tell me about it, huh?  Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica!  Ewwuck!

C: Susan Sarandon.
R: Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.

C: And here we go
R: I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.

C: Why, whats wrong with my bathroom floor?
R: Nothing. Its just old and dingy, thats all.

C: I highly doubt that.
R: Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah.

C: Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
R: Thats a little more than I wanted to see.

C: Why not?
R: Because its weird!

C: You want it?
R: Oh no.

C: Hello?
R: What's with her?

C: Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
R: Dude, you are sick.

C: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
R: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?

C: But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.
R: I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

C: Yeah, all of us! All day!
R: That sucks!

C: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
R: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.

C: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
R: Makes me wanna puke!

C: Look at this clown!
R: Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.

C: Get out of the way jackass!
R: Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?

C: Well, I dont think this, y'know.
R: No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.

C: No.
R: Eww!

C: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
R: We are bad people.

C: Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
R: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!

C: Bye.
R: Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.

C: Really?
R: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..

C: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
R: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?

C: Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
R: No, I dont think well be doing that.

C: No, I dont think well be doing that.
R: Were not gonna do that.

C: Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
R: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?

C: Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
R: Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.

C: Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
R: No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!

C: No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
R: The nerve huh?

C: The nerve huh?
R: Yeah!

C: How do you know?
R: The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."

C: Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
R: Wo-women? You mean like old women?

C: Well, hes very charming.
R: I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.

C: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
R: Ohh, get a room.

C: We have one.
R: I know. Use it.

C: He got it a flea market!
R: You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.

C: What?
R: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!

C: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
R: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.

C: Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
R: Nah!

C: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
R: Great. It's gym class all over again.

C: Ugh, she
R: God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!

C: Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes!
R: Hes taking off her coat!

C: Hes taking off her coat!
R: Oh, this is just terrible.

C: Come on, they're close.
R: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

C: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
R: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?

C: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
R: Oh my god, what were you thinking?

C: Ow!
R: I'm outta here.

C: I was so sure that was gonna work!
R: There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!

C: Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
R: Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!

C: Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
R: And yet, were still poking him.

C: Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.
R: Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.

C: I know, it's great!
R: Aww, I don't want to see that!

C: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
R: You two will have very hairy children.

C: Do you have any respect for your body?
R: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?

C: I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
R: Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like

C: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
R: It's worse than the thumb!

C: And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
R: I mean, what the hell is that thing?

C: Probably?
R: Yeah, I don't like that word.

C: Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
R: Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.

C: Hey Gunther, these yours?
R: Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!

C: Thanks Monica!
R: Does that smell bother you?

C: It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.
R: No, it’s worse than that.

C: No, it’s worse than that.
R: It’s wrong.

C: I dont know.
R: Why am I not surprised?

C: Here I am.
R: Wash your hands!!!

C: Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
R: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.

C: God. I feel violated.
R: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?

C: I am so, so, so, so sorry!
R: Uh-huh.

C: Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.
R: This place is so overpriced.

C: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
R: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."

C: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
R: Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!

C: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
R: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?

C: I said Ill do it!
R: Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself.

C: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
R: Oh damnit!

C: You still love me?
R: Noo.

C: Is that true miss?
R: Sells drugs to kids.

C: What?!
R: She sells drugs to kids.

C: How about we talk about this over dinner?
R: Okay lady, you're out of here.

C: Yeah!
R: No!

C: Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
R: YeahNo!!

C: I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.
R: I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...

C: I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...
R: Okay, goodbye...

C: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
R: That, that's what's stupid.

C: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
R: Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.

C: Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
R: Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.

C: Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
R: Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?

C: OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
R: We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...

C: Who's gonna take me to the
R: Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.

C: No.
R: : Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of

C: I mean, why should I let them meet him?
R: I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.

C: So, Ross and I are going to
R: Oh my God. He threw up?

C: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
R: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.

C: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
R: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.

C: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
R: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.

C: What's goin' on?
R: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.

C: I am strong! Ill show you!
R: Chandler please!

C: Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
R: No!!

C: No way!
R: No!

C: And stop using my name!
R: And shame on you!

C: And shame on you!
R: And shame on all of you!

C: And shame on all of you!
R: Youre disgusting!

C: Youre disgusting!
R: Especially you  with that!

C: Ben is way cuter than that kid.
R: I mean look at him, look at you,

C: Theyre wildly unpopular.
R: Oh my God!

C: Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
R: All right.

C: Oh!
R: ...Yeah, they were gross.

C: I don't know you guys.
R: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.

C: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
R: And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'

C: And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
R: And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'

C: And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
R: And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'

C: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
R: Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.

C: Oh this, well Im glad you asked.
R: Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?

C: So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
R: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.

C: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
R: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?

C: Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
R: Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.

C: Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
R: I officially give up.

C: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
R: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.

C: I mean, this is so cool!
R: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'

C: Who are you talking too?
R: Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.

C: All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
R: Yeah, this was a stupid idea.

C: Well I was just so excited to see you.
R: Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.

C: I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
R: I don't care if you    are my brother.

C: Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
R: I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.

C: Spoon?  So, what do you think?
R: Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.

C: This year was supposed to be great!
R: But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!

C: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
R: Oh, please!

C: All right, that Ill retract.
R: But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.

C: But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
R: Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!

C: Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
R: You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.

C: Hey, its been like three weeks!
R: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!

C: This-this happened when my grandfather died.
R: It's ugh!

C: And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
R: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.

C: But what about Phoebe?
R: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.

C: This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.
R: What the hells a matter with you?

C: Basically we just feel that he's...
R: We hate that guy.

C: We hate that guy.
R: Yeah. Hate him.

C: Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
R: ...No, we hate him.

C: Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
R: Have you ever seen so much crap?

C: Enh. Sure!
R: I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.

C: But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
R: Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!

C: Go!
R: Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.

C: I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
R: No, no!

C: No, no!
R: What are you crazy?!

C: Okay, whos next?!
R: No-o-o!  No way!

C: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
R: I ate a bug.

C: It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
R: Its so annoying.

C: Does it bug you?
R: You bug me.

C: Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here!
R: Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-

C: Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
R: Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.

C: Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
R: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.

C: Come on, they were not that huge.
R: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.

C: I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
R: When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.

C: When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
R: It made me nuts.
